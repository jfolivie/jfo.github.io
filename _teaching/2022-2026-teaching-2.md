<div style="text-align: justify">
Since September 2022, I have been a PRAG (equivalent to a full-time teacher) at Paris-Saclay University. I have mainly contributed to adapting the first and second years of the Bachelor's degree to the national BUT reform. My colleague Lionel Tinat and I founded and supervised the third-year specialisation in inorganic materials. This third year, which is available as an apprenticeship, covers fundamental knowledge and know-how in four areas of materials: synthesis, characterisation, processing and properties.

Overview
=======
Between 2022 and 2026, I have:
- Taught at all three levels of undergraduate chemistry (BUT1 →  BUT3)  
- Balanced activities across **lectures, tutorials, laboratory sessions, and project-based teaching**  
- Actively contributed to **applied and professional training** in chemistry and materials science  
- Maintained a pedagogical focus on **general chemistry, materials chemistry, thermodynamics, kinetics, electrochemistry, physics and scientific computing**

Undergraduate Teaching — BUT 1 (First-Year Students)
======
Taught a range of foundational courses for first-year students in the **Bachelor Universitaire de Technologie (BUT) in Chemistry**, including **lectures (CM)**, **tutorials (TD)**, and **laboratory sessions (TP)**. I thought about these topics: 
- General Chemistry, Solutions and Nomenclature, Chemical Equilibria (TP, SAé) 
- Good Laboratory Practices (TP)  
- Thermochemistry and Applied Thermodynamics (TD, TP) 
- Molecular Spectroscopic Methods of Analysis (TP)
- Chemical Kinetics, Atomistic Chemistry (TD, TP)
- Inorganic Materials Science (TD)

Also contributed to **portfolio supervision**, **PPP (Personal and Professional Project)** modules, and **tutoring and evaluation** of first-year student projects (*SAÉ Analyser and Synthétiser*).

Intermediate Teaching — BUT 2 (Second-Year Students)
======
Involved in both theoretical and applied chemistry courses within the **Analysis, Quality Control, and Environment** specialization. Teaching included **tutorials (TD)**, **laboratory sessions (TP)**, and occasional **lectures (CM)** in:
- Inorganic Materials: structure, symmetries and defaults (TD, TP)
- Materials Properties: batteries (CM, TD, TP)
- Applied Electrochemistry and Electrochemical Techniques (TD, TP)
- Inorganic Synthesis Concepts and Synthesis (TD, TP, SAé)
- Characterization and Formulation of Materials (SAé)
- Alloys: Chemical potential applied to pure substances and alloys; Construction and interpretation of the phase diagrams; Metallography (CM, TD, TP) 

Supervised **applied projects (SAÉ 4.1 & 4.2)** focusing on chemical analysis, synthesis, and materials characterization bridging chemistry and materials science.

---

Advanced / Specialized Teaching — BUT 3 (Advanced Undergraduate Level)
=======
Built and contributed to advanced and specialized modules combining **lectures**, **tutorials**, and **project supervision**, covering:
- Polymers (TP)
- Materials for energy: fuel cells (CM, TD)
- Materials for energy: band structure and application to solar cells (CM, TD, TP)
- Relations structures/properties - electric and thermic properties (CM, TD, TP)
- Physics applied to materials (CM, TD, TP)

These modules emphasize the integration of theoretical understanding with laboratory practice, data modelization and interpretation, and research-oriented problem-solving.

Academic Supervision and Support Activities
=======
- Supervision of **laboratory internships** and **industrial apprenticeship**  
- **Tutoring and mentoring** of students, including guidance in professional orientation and project design  
- **Assessment design, exam supervision, and grading** for chemistry and materials courses  
- Participation in **curriculum design**
- **Administrative responsibilities** in the third year include managing the teaching team, planning lectures, and liaising with the CFA and industry
- **Operation and investment in the structure:** project elaboration and management, quotation to industrials, and commands
