Overview
=======

This website showcases my work as a teacher in chemistry (professeur agrégé) and researcher in theoretical and computational chemistry. After a few years as a full-time teacher, I am now returning to full-time research in order to find a job in the next few years that strikes a better balance between these two areas of interest.

My website
=======
This website is derived from [AcademicPages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) templates.

Share my work
=======
Over the next few years, I will use this website to share my work as a teacher and researcher, presenting the documents I have created and the codes I have developed. All my work can be used, and improved, under a Creative Commons licence (CC-BY-SA).
